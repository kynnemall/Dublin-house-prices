        House price predictions were generated using an artificial intelligence 
        model based on factors such as Building Energy Rating (BER), postcode, 
        number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The primary purpose of 
        this app is to aid users in understanding whether property prices may 
        be over or under an expected value based on the provided information.

        It is important to note that the predicted values are model 
        approximations and should not be regarded as definitive or guaranteed 
        prices. This app is also part of a small project aimed at 
        investigating how available property specifications may influence 
        market prices.

        Real estate markets are intricate and influenced by various dynamic 
        factors such as supply and demand. The AI model may not account for all 
        these variables, and users are advised to use the predicted values as 
        general estimates rather than precise indicators.
